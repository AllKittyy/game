# Game

Demo game for Flutter and Flutter Sprites.

## Getting Started

To build and run the game, first make sure that you have
[Flutter](http://flutter.io/) installed and set up. You will also need a device
setup (follow the directions on the Flutter page).

Next, clone the game repo to a directory next to your flutter directory. The
game repo and the flutter repo need to be in the same directory.

    git clone https://github.com/flutter/game.git

When in the game directory, you can run the game with:

    pub get
    flutter start

Enjoy the amazing game action on your favorite device!
